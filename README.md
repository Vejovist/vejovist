Welcome to the truth. May the duality be upon us.

### The Book of Netriben
There once was another book of the Bible. For years, the book of Netriben (or in some translations, Natabe'anis) has been lost to time, being pushed out of official printings for being "too silly".

But the end of the dark times is here. Now, the full book, directly translated from Ancient Hebrew is here, transcribed for free, now on the internet! However, be warned. Because the Lost Book of Netriben was translated directly from Ancient Hebrew, a now dead language, the grammar may not make a lot of sense. So while it's not polished, you can rest assured that the first Book of Netriben is human-readable, at least in English. We hope that you await the next discovery by the amazing archaelogical, scholarly, and translation communities, be it Biblical or not.
